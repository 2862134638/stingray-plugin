You can add Stingray project and engine resources here that will get
mapped for every project while this plugin is loaded.

Mapped resources can be accessed at runtime just like any project
resources. In example, for this folder resource extension,
named `example_resources`, you could access resources in that folder with
the following scheme: `example_resources/my_lua_scripts/player.lua`.
